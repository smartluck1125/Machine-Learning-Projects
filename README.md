### 1. [Classification of Arrhythmia using ECG Data](https://github.com/shsarv/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Classification%20of%20Arrhythmia)

- Our goal was to predict if a person is suffering from cardiac arrhythmia or not, and if yes, classify it in to one of 12 available groups.

- The Dataset used in this project is available at the UCI machine learning Repository. It can be found [Here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arrhythmia).

- The best Model was Kernalized SVM over PCA Data.

- **Accuracy achieved = 80.21%**
