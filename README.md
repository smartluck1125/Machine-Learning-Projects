## List of Projects:- 
### 1. [Classification of Arrhythmia using ECG Data](https://github.com/shsarv/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Classification%20of%20Arrhythmia)

#### &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[Notebook File](https://github.com/shsarv/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Classification%20of%20Arrhythmia/final%20with%20pca.ipynb) &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[Complete Project](https://github.com/shsarv/Project-Arrhythmia) &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[Dataset](https://github.com/shsarv/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Classification%20of%20Arrhythmia/Data/arrhythmia.csv)

- The goal of this project is to predict if a person is suffering from cardiac arrhythmia or not and if yes, classify it into one of 12 available groups.
- The Dataset used in this project is available at the UCI machine learning Repository. It can be found [Here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arrhythmia).
- The best Model was Kernelized SVM over PCA Data.
- **Accuracy achieved = 80.21%**

### 2. [Diabetes-prediction](https://github.com/shsarv/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Diabetes%20Prediction)

#### &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[Notebook File](https://github.com/shsarv/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Diabetes%20Prediction/Diabetes%20Classification.ipynb) &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[Complete Deployed Project](https://github.com/shsarv/Diabetes-prediction) &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; [Dataset](https://github.com/shsarv/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Diabetes%20Prediction/dataset) &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; [Working Link](https://sarvdiabetes-predictions.herokuapp.com/)
- The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
- The data set that has used in this project has taken from the kaggle . "This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.  
- Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage".
- The model best worked on this dataset was Random Forest Classifier.
- **Accuracy achieved = 98.75%**
