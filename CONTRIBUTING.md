* If you see an issue already created, that you think you can resolve, comment on it and ask the maintainers to assign it to you. We will be more than glad to do so :)

* Commit message should be of the stated syntax. Use only absolute verbs like Create, Update, etc and no past or future tenses like creating/created.

* Add comments to codes. This increases readability. However do not raise issues or PRs only to add comments.
